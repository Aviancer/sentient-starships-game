In place of three weapons, a starship maybe equipped with mining rippers – drills and scoops that eat through a planet or asteroid's surface and extract valuable materials. 
Mining rippers can extract two tons of material each round though the ship must be moving at only 1 square per round for the device to work – any faster and the mining rippers are torn off and are completely destroyed. 
The device instantly feeds the mined materials directly into a designated cargohold on the ship.
