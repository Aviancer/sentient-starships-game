CREATING YOUR CHARACTERS

As a starship character, this will require a bit of tweaking from normal character generation.  Of course, you shall be appropriate starships, with information found in the D20 Future SRD.  Please select from ultralight, light, or medium class starship categories.  This is available here:  http://spellbooksoftware.com/d20mrsd/futureships.html Pick your base ship size and stats from one of the predone models (and note it) i.e., courier, strike cruiser, etc.  You will design your starship self as per your own wishes. With the additional ship options noted at the end of this document.  Further information on many of the optional components not found in the SRD documentation will come from supplemental documentation, which can be found in http://dragons-burrow.com/dnd/ as well as a backup copy of the d20mrsd set.

For your starting selves, you will pick from systems as noted for your size class (Up to PL 8), (there's a limit of 2-4 special systems) however you may take an additional defensive, engine, communication, data libraries or special system by taking a 'flaw' (up to two flaws may be selected this way).  This flaw will be focused on personality and rolls, which can be selected from https://www.d20pfsrd.com/extras/community-creations/flaws/ or https://www.d20pfsrd.com/traits/drawbacks/ or https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/3.5e_Flaws.  Please be sure to pick relevant ones (IE, no magical based ones).  Yes, Clinically Depressed Robot is an option and only one of you may acquire it.  This may be done up to two times at starting, though there will be options for removal of flaws later in the game plan.

For the actual player portion of your ship self, follow the rules for a 'bioreplica' robot as laid out here: http://spellbooksoftware.com/d20mrsd/futurerobots.html  note that hit points, armor, and so on will be based with your ship self rather than this information. Dex is 1d6 + 10. Int, Wis, Cha are generated by rolling 4d6, dropping the lowest, these rolls may be assigned to stats as you see fit.  You may then pick from a character subtype as per the Core SRD basic classes http://spellbooksoftware.com/d20mrsd/basicclasses.html. However, when you level, your HD will not increase.  Instead, you may 'pool' your increases from HD to 'buy' improvements to your ship self from the weaponry, comm, defensive, and special subsystems, or upgrade an existing system.  You will also have slots for 3 libraries of data to be installed.  This pool includes the below categories:

Arcane Lore: The occult, magic and the supernatural, astrology, numerology, and similar topics.
Art: Fine arts and graphic arts, including art history and artistic techniques. Antiques, modern art, photography, and performance art forms such as music and dance, among others.
Astronomy:  The knowledge of stars and wayfinding via them, detection and other means.
Behavioral Sciences: Psychology, sociology, and criminology.
Business: Business procedures, investment strategies, and corporate structures. Bureaucratic procedures and how to navigate them.
Civics: Law, legislation, litigation, and legal rights and obligations. Political and governmental institutions and processes.
Construction: The building of buildings, vehicles, and other common constructs.
Current Events: Recent happenings in the news, sports, politics, entertainment, and foreign affairs.
Earth and Life Sciences: Biology, botany, genetics, geology, and paleontology. Medicine and forensics.
History: Events, personalities, and cultures of the past. Archaeology and antiquities.
Military:  Knowledge of all things military in structure and nature, both planetside and space based.
Planetary Sciences:  Knowledge of formation, resources, and so on of various planets and moonlets not found via general scans.
Physical Sciences: Astronomy, chemistry, mathematics, physics, and engineering.
Popular Culture: Popular music and personalities, genre films and books, urban legends, comics, science fiction, and gaming, among others.
Starships:  Knowledge of various ship designs, models, abilities, so on.
Streetwise: Street and urban culture, local underworld personalities and events.
Tactics: Techniques and strategies for disposing and maneuvering forces in combat.
Technology: Current developments in cutting-edge devices, as well as the background necessary to identify various technological devices.
Theology and Philosophy: Liberal arts, ethics, philosophical concepts, and the study of religious faith, practice, and experience.

For your character, you should:

* Have idea of your ship structure appearance and abilities.  Feel free to describe in 1-2 paragraphs!
* Maybe a short personality archetype for moving forward.
* also note what kind of sentient AI you are! (grown from scratch, human cloned, transplanted brain, etc)



If any questions arise we'll work through it here!

SETTING:

We will be functionally an early PL8 society on the progress level scale.  This means a lot of options are open to you for your ship-selves.  We will also be going by fantastical travel times, there will both be pure system jumping as well as massive star-gate based jumping, so be prepared!  Additionally, be aware you may at times have to transport biologic creatures, at least some of you.  Keep that in mind.
